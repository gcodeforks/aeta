The test app has a particular test data setup. Both, the unit and the
end-to-end tests are indivually linked into the app's root directory. This
allows us to test a custom aeta.yaml setting. Since both types of tests expect
a tests.utils module, it separately linked as well.

The same setup if mirrored in the other e2e test app.
