===============================
App Engine Test Appendix (AETA)
===============================

Short Description
=================

A test runner for Python App Engine that allows run tests in App Engine
environments.  It lives at http://code.google.com/p/aeta/.


Installation
============

You can install this library in addition to your existing application. No
changes to your existing app are required.

1. Copy the aeta directory into the application's root directory.
2. Add the following snippet to your app.yaml file:

  handlers:
  ...
  - url: /tests/.*
    script: aeta.main.APP

or if you are using Python 2.5:

  - url: /tests/.*
    script: aeta/main.py


There is no need to add access restrictions; using aeta requires administrative
privileges by default.


Configuration
=============

If you stick to the defaults, no configuration is needed at all. The default
settings can be found at aeta/aeta.yaml.

If you want to customize aeta's configuration, copy the aeta.yaml into your
app's root directory and tweak the settings to your needs.

Among several options, you can define packages which contain tests, a pattern
to identify test-relevant modules, or set the URL path at which your tests will
be accessible.
